<p>Check back here for the voting link. We're using a Condorcet method, which basically means you should provide a list of candidates to us, in order of preference.</p>

<h3>Voter Eligibility</h3>
<p>To be eligible to vote you must be active in the tech or web industry in Madison.

At worst we'll contact you to learn who you are.</p>
